/*
OOP: A programming paradigm that uses the concepts of classes and objects

Class: Blueprint / Template from where objects are created
Object: An instance of a class

Four main principles of OOP
Encapsulation: Restricting data so that it can not be accessed by other class.
Inheritance: We can use the properties, functions of a class in another class. (Help with code reusability)
Abstraction: Hiding complex functionalities from user and show simple stuff
Polymorphism: (In bangla: Onek rup taar. XD) Reusing same function to achieve different behavior
