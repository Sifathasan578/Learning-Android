rotation problem
solve of rotation problem

when rotate even if you are in the next question you will see the first one. 

solution in chapter 4

understand root cause to deal with related bugs

Activity States and Lifecycle Callbacks

States of activity:
	non-existent
	stopped
	paused
	resumed

onCreate()
onStart()
onResume()
onPause()
onStop()
onRestart()
onDestroy()

Didn't get it very much. Not the activity cycle that I studied:

I understand the functions, but unable to correlate with the states. 

Nonexistent -> onCreate() -> Stopped -> onStart() -> Paused -> onResume() -> Resumed -> onPause() -> Paused -> onStop() -> Stopped -> onDestroy() -> Nonexistent

3.4
	has instance in memory
	is visible to user
	is active in the foreground
	

lifecycle callback functions
	onCreate(Bundle?)
	
	
sending log messages
	
// more deeper
public static Int d(String tag, String msg)

MainActivity Filter in logcat
hide kore ekhon vanish hoye geche

why use override, 
super keyword

familiarize with logcat functionalitites

Start app
	onCreate(Bundle?)
	onStart() 
	onResume() -> Resumed State(mem, vis, fore)
	
Temp Leave
	Press home button when app running
	
	onPause()
	onStop() -> 
	Stopped State(mem, not vis, not fore)
	not onDestroy(): you can come back
	
	if I return to this activity again and if it is in stopped state then:
		onRestart()
		onStart()
		onResume()
		Resumed State
		
	sometimes on onStop() OS can destroy the app
	
understood the activity hands on

Bundle?: ???
	
paused state: partial visible
because new activity can be transparent, small screen window, multi window

split screen view

back: 
	onPause()
	onStop()
	onDestroy() [if app wants]
	NonExistance State
	

Reason behind bug
Why os destroys activity when rotates
	changes device configuration
	Explanation


created landscape layout

android view: summary of the files

configuration qualifier
	android identifies which resources best match for current device configuration
	
landscape and default layout
	in landscape mode android will pick it, otherwise default
	
	FrameLayout is used here
	


# UI Updates and Multi-Window
Mode

Pre-Nougat: Don't have dual functionality

In dual video mode video stops when you are trying to chat with a different screen

Solution: 
Move your playback resuming and pausing to onStart() and
onStop(). This goes for any live-updating data, like a photo gallery app that refreshes to show new
images as they are pushed to a Flickr stream (as you will see later in this book).
In short, in the post-Nougat world, your activities should update the UI during their entire visible
lifecycle, from onStart() to onStop().

This is explain more clearly later!


#Log Levels
	A level that species how important the log message is
	
Log.e: Errors
Log.w: Warnings
Log.i: Informaitonal Messages
Log.d: Debug Output
Log.v: Development Only

Log function's second parameter can be used as Throwable also takes those two arguments

// Log a message at DEBUG log level
// Finding error for index out of bounds
Log.d(TAG, "Current question index: $currentIndex")
try {
	val question = questionBank[currentIndex]
} catch (ex: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) {
	// Log a message at ERROR log level, along with an exception stack trace
	Log.e(TAG, "Index was out of bounds", ex)
}
